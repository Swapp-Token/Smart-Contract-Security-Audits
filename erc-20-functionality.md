# 2.4.2 - ERC-20 Functionality

The Swapp platform can be used on both the [Ethereum blockchain](https://eth.swapp.ee) as well as the [Binance Smart Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0efe961c733ff46ce34c56a73eba0c6a0e18e0f5).

The SWAPP contract conforms fully with the ERC-20 token standard, as proposed in [EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md). This is essentially a set of functions that a token contract must implement in order to be an ERC-20 token.

This ERC-20 standard compliance means that applications, websites, exchanges, and smart contracts can very easily integrate with or be built on top of the SWAPP contract.
