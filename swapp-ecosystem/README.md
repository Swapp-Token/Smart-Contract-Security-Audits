It is truly international and decentralized team when it comes to diversity. There are people from 10 different countries, including Estonia, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Nigeria and Poland.

The team is made up of people who know a lot about finance, cyber-forensics, technology, development, and crypto. They have worked together to create our vision for the future.
