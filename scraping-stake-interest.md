# 2.3.9.1 - Cashing out INTR$T

Users will have the ability to withdraw \(scrape\) any amount of earned INTR$T from an active stake \(i.e. before the stake fully matures\).

Users can choose exactly how much INTR$T they wish to cash out, up to the maximum \(all accrued, unscraped INTR$T from all previous days\). Scraping INTR$T from an active stake can be done multiple times over the course of the stake.

Scraping INTR$T is possible after each epoch \(monthly run\) is completed.

When a stake is closed, whether active or mature, the INTR$T minted back to the user only includes INTR$T that hasn’t already been scraped.

Cashing out INTR$T will not affect the stake’s principal, but will reduce the number of INTR$T shares the stake has going forward. This effectively means that the stake will earn slightly less INTR$T on the current and all future days of the stake than it otherwise would have. This INTR$T share reduction also prevents users from being able to end up with more overall INTR$T shares if they choose to immediately re-stake their scraped INTR$T.

Scraping interest during a stake reduces the growth rate of the accumulating interest, so keep in mind that if interest is cashed out along the way, the user will end up with less interest collected by the end of the stake.
