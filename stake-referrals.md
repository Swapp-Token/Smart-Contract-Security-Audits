# 2.2.5 - Staking Referral Bonus

The Swapp smart contract includes a powerful referral program to incentivize users to invite family/friends into the ecosystem.

When a user opens a new stake, the front-end interface checks whether the user came to the page using an affiliate's tracking link. If so, then the referrer's wallet address should populate in the referrer field on the staking page, giving that wallet credit for that stake \(and all future stakes from that referred user\).

Swapp uses a blockchain-powered, multi-tier \(2 level\) affiliate model designed to be lucrative for both early adopters as well as professional affiliate marketers.

Anyone can become a referral partner by simply navigating to the Swapp dashboard, connecting their wallet, and clicking to generate their unique referral link.
