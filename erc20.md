# ERC20

The Swapp platform can be used on both the [Ethereum blockchain ](https://etherscan.io/token/0x8cb924583681cbfe487a62140a994a49f833c244)as well as the [Binance Smart Chain](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0efe961c733ff46ce34c56a73eba0c6a0e18e0f5).

The SWAPP contract conforms fully with the ERC-20 token standard, as proposed in [EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md). This is essentially a set of functions that a token contract must implement in order to be an ERC-20 token.

This ERC-20 standard compliance means that applications, websites, exchanges, and smart contracts can very easily integrate with or be built on top of the SWAPP contract.



**Built on Ethereum, now also available on Binance Smart Chain**

SWAPP also exists on Binance Smart Chain as a [BEP-20 token](https://bscscan.com/address/0x0efe961c733ff46ce34c56a73eba0c6a0e18e0f5) and can be traded on [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0x0efe961c733ff46ce34c56a73eba0c6a0e18e0f5). There are plans to expand SWAPP on to additional chains including Polygon, Cronos\(crypto.com chain\), and others.

This document is a general technical specification of the contract and its functionality.
