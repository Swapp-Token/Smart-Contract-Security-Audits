# 2.3.2 - Minting Tokens

Once the auction phase Epoch has ended and the Circulation Epoch has begun, users may now earn newly minted SWAPP tokens as interest rewards -- upon the end of each epoch.

The minting of SWAPP is done on-demand by the user, in a single batch, through the front-end interface. The interface will show how many SWAPP the user can mint, broken down by reservation and/or referral bonus sources. Users may mint their SWAPP immediately, or wait as long as they like, without penalty.

Users will likely want to mint their SWAPP sooner rather than later in order to take advantage of [staking](staking.md) them to earn monthly reward on their staking; SWAPP tokens earned by staking; or by referring others to stake in staking pools.
