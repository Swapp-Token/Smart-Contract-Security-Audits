# 4.0.0 - Conclusion

The Swapp Foundation sincerely hopes that our efforts to provide the general public with a trustless, decentralized, interest-bearing instrument will bear fruit, and that SWAPP will be a great success. But, we canâ€™t achieve these goals without the help of the community around us.

The SWAPP project was started not with the intention to profit, but from the desire to create something incredibly useful for the world. We hope this document has made our vision and intentions clear.

We welcome any questions, comments, or criticism you may have. We also have some need for various types of contributors to the project.

Please join us in the [official SWAPP Telegram group at t.me/SwappToken](https://t.me/swapptoken) to discuss the SWAPP project with the founders, developers, supporters, critics, and the rest of the community.
