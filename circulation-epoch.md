# 2.3.0 - Circulation Epoch

When the final launch phase epoch day ends, the Circulation Epoch begins. At this point, no further token reservations can be made.

Upon completion of the Q2 2021 launch phase, reserved SWAPP may then be minted by users, as they choose to claim. Users may begin [staking SWAPP](https://swapp.org/whitepaper#sec-2-3-5). 85% or more of all ETH sent into the auction phase smart contract and a matching batch of SWAPP is automatically [sent to Uniswap](liquidity-transformer-epoch.md), so users may begin trading SWAPP and ETH there. All [standard ERC-20 functions](erc-20-functionality.md) involving minted tokens are also now available.

Once the launch phase epoch has ended, the smart contract's functions for the circulation epoch become active.
